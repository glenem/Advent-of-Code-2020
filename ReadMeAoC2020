Hello everyone!

This is my first time attempting to complete Advent of Code for 2020. 
I wanted to try Advent of Code because I always wanted to give it a try and one of my co-workers from my internship recomended it to me. 

So I will be using Python to complete the Advent of Code 2020 challenges to improve my Python programming skills and have fun solving puzzles.
